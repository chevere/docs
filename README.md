# Get started

Build extensible server-side progressive applications for modern PHP.

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a strict, strong-typed, immutable PHP development framework. It is the kind of stuff developers use to build *other* software. It is an small software package providing the strictly necessary tooling for developing the logic of any given software application.

ðŸ’¡ The term *chÃ©vere* is ubiquitous in Latin America, known in every Spanish speaking country and it means **cool, awesome**.

## Why Chevere and not X?

Chevere top selling argument is quality. We enforce testing, full code coverage and mutation testing of all the components in our organization. Our code is tested and scrutinized using several code quality tools, with public reports and stats.

There's also our culture, where contrary to most PHP frameworks, Chevere is not designed for anything in specific and we don't embrace or forbid any development model. Chevere is the stuff for those needing to rely in good quality components without the bloated package.

ðŸ’¡ Chevere is a tiny development layer (~400 kb) that you can use in any existing project.

## Clean & Typed

Enjoy an immutable and strong-typed clean codebase. Chevere follows [Clean Code](http://cleancoder.com/products) principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

## Extensible

Do more building pluggable software with components. Chevere provides an immutable core library, a tooling for general purposes with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how.

## Modern & High quality

All-new PHP 8 codebase with strict standards. Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own high [quality](../architecture/standard/quality.md) standards.

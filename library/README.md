# PHP library

Chevere provides a thin-layer for low-level system abstractions that we consider as strictly neccesary elements to develop modern PHP software.

👉 You can use any of our **packages** for tailored extra functionality.

💡 Our library and packages can be used in *any system*, everything comes with low-dependency requirements and the same top-quality.

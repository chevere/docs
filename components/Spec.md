# Spec

The Spec component is in charge of creating a distributed JSON representation for the endpoints in a given [Router](./Router.md), allowing to provide instructions in how to interact with the application exposed endpoints.

## Files

Table below summarizes the type of files created by the Spec component.

| Name                | Path                           | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `index.json`        | /                              | The entire Spec in one single file           |
| `routes.json`       | /`<repository>`/               | Sub-spec for routes in the given repository  |
| `route.json`        | /`<repository>`/`<routePath>`/ | Sub-spec for endpoints in a given route path |
| `<methodName>.json` | /`<repository>`/`<routePath>`/ | Sub-spec a given method name                 |

## Format

Code below shows and example tree representation for a router containing `GET /route-path/{id}`.

```sh
└── spec <- 1st level
    ├── index.json
    └── repository <- 2nd level
        ├── route-path
        │   └── {id} <- routePath: /spec/repository/route-path/{id}
        │       ├── GET.json
        │       └── route.json
        └── routes.json
```

### First-level

This only contains `index.json` and folders for each routing repository.

### Second-level

The each folder at the second level represents a routing repository, and contains a `routes.json` file with the Spec for the routes in the repository. Sub-folders will be used accordingly to reflect the declared [Routing](./Router.md#routing).

For the example above, `/spec/repository/route-path/{id}/GET.json` provides the Spec for `GET /route-path/{id}`.

## Creating Spec

A SpecMaker is in charge of creating the Spec. [SpecMakerInterface](../reference/Chevere/Interfaces/Spec/SpecMakerInterface.md) describes the interface for the component in charge of defining a SpecMaker.

```php
use Chevere\Components\Spec\SpecMaker;
use Chevere\Components\Router\Router;
use function Chevere\Components\Filesystem\dirForPath;

/**
 * @var Router $router
 */
new SpecMaker(
    specDir: dirForPath('/spec/'),
    outputDir: dirForPath('/var/public/spec/'),
    router: $router
);
```

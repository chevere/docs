# Router

The Router component is defined by the [RouterInterface](../reference/Chevere/Interfaces/Router/RouterInterface.md) and it is a collection of objects implementing [RouteableInterface](../reference/Chevere/Interfaces/Router/RoutableInterface.md).

The system is built on top of [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) but with our own cache and other context-aware improvements.

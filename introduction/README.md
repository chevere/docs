## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a strict, strong-typed PHP development library. It is the stuff developers use to build *other* software, specially low-level applications as it is an small software package providing the core tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application.

ðŸ’¡ The term *chÃ©vere* is ubiquitous in Latin America, known in every Spanish speaking country and it means **cool/awesome**. We believe that anything can be chevere, specially PHP software.

## Core concepts

### Clean & Typed

Enjoy an immutable and strong-typed clean codebase. Chevere follows [Clean Code](http://cleancoder.com/products) principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

### Extensible

A core library tooling for general purposes, with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how. We also provide packages for specific needs.

### Modern & High quality

All-new PHP 8 codebase with strict standards. Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own high [quality](../developer/standard/quality.md) standards.

## Why Chevere and not X?

If you can use software from *well-known* vendors why you should use Chevere?

Main reason for Chevere is its high quality with a clean syntax. You can tell that by interacting with Chevere and because the code is scrutinized by several third-party tools.

It is day and night when the arguments to use a codebase are vague subjective terms like *expressive syntax* or *well-maintained* compared to objetive code measure metrics.

## Who makes Chevere?

Chevere is driven by [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) and is made by the same author ([Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com), hi) with solid 18+ years of experience building systems.

Chevere was created as the supporting framework for Chevereto, and Chevereto supports Chevere's development.

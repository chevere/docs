# Get started

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a strict, strong-typed PHP development library. It is the stuff developers use to build *other* software as it is a collection of packages providing the core tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application.

ðŸ’¡ The term *chÃ©vere* is ubiquitous in Latin America, known in every Spanish speaking country and it means **cool/awesome**.

## Core concepts

### Clean & Typed

Chevere follows Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

### Extensible

Packages of all types, with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how.

### Modern & High quality

All-new PHP 8 codebase with strict standards. Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own high [quality](../developer/standard/quality.md) standards.

## Who makes Chevere?

Chevere is driven by [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) and is made by the same author ([Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com), hi).

Chevere was created as the supporting framework for Chevereto, and Chevereto supports Chevere's development.

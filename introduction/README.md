## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a strict, strong-typed PHP development library. It is the kind of stuff developers use to build *other* software, specially low-level applications as it is an small unbloated software package providing the core tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application.

ðŸ’¡ The term *chÃ©vere* is ubiquitous in Latin America, spreaded in every spanish speaking country and it means **cool/awesome**. We believe that anything can be chevere, specially PHP software.

## Core concepts

### Clean & Typed

Enjoy an immutable and strong-typed clean codebase. Chevere follows [Clean Code](http://cleancoder.com/products) principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

### Extensible

A core library tooling for general purposes, with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how. We also provide packages for very specific needs.

### Modern & High quality

All-new PHP 8 codebase with strict standards. Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own high [quality](../developer/standard/quality.md) standards.

## Why Chevere and not X?

...Or if you can use software from well-known vendors with dozen  releases all the time and hundreds of contributors, why you should use our stuff?

* This codebase is measured top-quality, highly maintainable software.
* In the event this project gets [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) zero it will require a minimum investment to keep your projects delivering.
* Backed by a [self-hosted software](https://chevereto.com) used in thousand of different server configurations.
* The foundation is being crafted to last 20 years. We started in 2018.

## Who makes Chevere?

Chevere is driven by [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) and is made by the same author ([Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com), hi). Chevere was created as the supporting framework for Chevereto, and Chevereto supports Chevere's development.

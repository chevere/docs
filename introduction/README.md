# Get started

Build extensible server-side progressive applications for modern PHP.

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a strict, strong-typed PHP development library. It is the kind of stuff developers use to build *other* software, specially low-level applications as it is an small unbloated software package providing the core tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application.

ðŸ’¡ The term *chÃ©vere* is ubiquitous in Latin America, spreaded in every spanish speaking country and it means **cool/awesome**. We believe that anything can be chevere, specially PHP software.

## Why Chevere

### Clean & Typed

Enjoy an immutable and strong-typed clean codebase. Chevere follows [Clean Code](http://cleancoder.com/products) principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

### Extensible

Do more building pluggable software with components. Chevere provides an immutable core library, a tooling for general purposes with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how.

### Modern & High quality

All-new PHP 8 codebase with strict standards. Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own high [quality](../developer/standard/quality.md) standards.

## Who makes Chevere?

Chevere is driven by [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) and is made by the same author ([Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com), hi).

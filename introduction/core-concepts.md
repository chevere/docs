## Extensibility

Chevere ease the process of crafting pluggable applications by providing an architecture allowing to safely extend the application logic. Extensible applications not only do more, but engage more users and provide a solid foundation for your own application ecosystem.

> 🤯 Pluggable logic allows to be open to do *more*.

## Clean Code

Chevere follows the Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

> 🧔 _Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._

## Strongly Typed

Chevere uses strict strong-types for safe run-time operations. It relies mostly on the language to avoid boilerplate code needed to validate dynamic types. This also helps to better understand the code as everything is typed.

> 😘 IDEs and code tools love typed code

## Console First

Chevere is built for the console first, not web. On its core, Chevere is a simple command runner which can me mapped to generate anything. This approach makes Chevere flexible enough to provide all the building blocks needed to create modern applications of any kind. It also gets rid of the need of a web server for development.

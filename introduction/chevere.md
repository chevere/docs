## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a development framework for building **extensible** server side applications. Unlike almost all other PHP frameworks, Chevere is designed for *everything*, not just web. The core library provides the tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given application like Content Management Systems, headless-APIs and more.

### Name meaning

The term *[chÃ©vere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ch%C3%A9vere)* is an slang used in latin american countries. It literally means *terrific*, *cool*, *great*, *awesome*, *nifty*, etc. The term has a generic connotation of good/cool and can be used in almost any context that those two words can be used.

## Origin

Chevere begun as the supporting framework for [Chevereto 4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto). Development started about mid-2018, carrying a complete modernization of the previous Chevereto's supporting framework ([G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/)).

While Chevereto drove initial development, Chevere is a different organization with their own goals, shapped by their contributors and users.

> Both Chevere and Chevereto are projects started by the same developer, [Rodolfo Berrios](https://github.com/rodolfoberrios) (ðŸ˜‰ hi!).

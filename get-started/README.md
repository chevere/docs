# Introduction

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a development framework for building **extensible** server side applications. Unlike almost all other PHP frameworks, Chevere is designed for *everything*, not just web. The core library provides the tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given application like command line tools, Content Management Systems, headless-APIs and more.

### Naming

The term *[chévere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ch%C3%A9vere)* is an slang used in latin american countries. It literally means *cool*, *great* or *awesome*. The term has a generic connotation of good and can be used in almost any context that those two words can be used.

The name was ripped from [Chevereto](#origin).

## Core concepts

### Extensibility

Chevere aims to ease the process of crafting pluggable applications by providing an architecture allowing to safely extend the application logic. Extensible applications not only do more, but engage more users and provide a solid foundation for your own application ecosystem.

> 🤯 Pluggable logic allows to be open to do *more*.

### Clean & Typed

Chevere follows the Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

> ✨ _Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._
> ― Michael Feathers

It uses strict strong-types for safe run-time operations. It relies mostly on the language to avoid boilerplate code needed to validate dynamic types. Everything is typed.

> 🤩 IDEs, code tools and very good devs love typed code

### General Purpose

Chevere is not web-centric and it is tech neutral allowing you to create a myriad of systems with the same know-how.

On its core, Chevere is a simple command runner which can me mapped to do _anything_. This approach makes Chevere flexible enough to provide all the building blocks needed to create modern applications of any kind.

> 💎 Chevere is built for the console first so you can drop the slowness of web based development

### Standard

Everything in Chevere feels in place, like something that it was diligently made by a single person. Surprise, it does!

Chevere is made by a One Man Army developer and it express the vision of years of experience developing software and systems. It is highly opinionated, establishing many coding standards and rules seeking for cohesion and the best usage of the programming language.

> 👨‍💻 Fits like a glove!

## Origin

Chevere begun as the supporting framework for [Chevereto 4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto). Development started about mid-2018, carrying a complete modernization of the previous Chevereto's supporting framework ([G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/)).

While Chevereto drove initial development, Chevere is a different organization with its own goals, shaped by their users.

> Both Chevere and Chevereto are made by the same developer, [Rodolfo Berrios](https://github.com/rodolfoberrios) (Hey there 👋🏾).

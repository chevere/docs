# Introduction

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a general purpose PHP development framework made for building extensible [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) applications. Unlike almost all other frameworks, Chevere is designed for *everything*, not just web and it provides the tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application from command line tools, Content Management Systems, headless-APIs up to anything you may think of.

Chevere has this flexibility and mindset because it has been designed to be used to create [self-hosted software](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

### Name meaning

The term *[chévere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ch%C3%A9vere)* is a very well known word in spanish speaking countries which means *cool*, *excellent*, *great*, *awesome*, *pretty*, *nice* and *magnific*. The term has a generic connotation of good and can be used in almost any positive context.

The use of the term has roots in the [Chevereto](#origin) software..

## Core concepts

### Clean & Typed

Chevere follows Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

It uses strict strong-types for safe run-time operations and relies mostly on the language to avoid boilerplate code needed to validate dynamic types.

> ✨ Typed code is easier to read and safer to work with. You will notice it when you work with it.

### General Purpose

Chevere is tech-neutral and it provides an immutable core library suitable to build _anything_. The tooling is for general purposes, with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how.

> 🏭  It is tech neutral and not web-centric. Your knowledge does more here.

### Indie Developed

Everything in Chevere feels right in its place, like something that it was diligently designed by a single person with a wide context of service provision and user needs.

> 👨🏾‍💻 It is the result of years of iteration and user feedback.

### Extensible

Chevere provides the tooling you need to safely extend and plug-in addons to the application logic. Extensible applications not only do more, also engage more users and provide a solid foundation for your own application ecosystem.

> 🔌 Pluggable logic allows to be open to do *more*.

### Consistent

The code base and the whole project is highly opinionated, with many coding standards and conventions seeking for cohesion.

> 💎 It is the result of the best usage (in my opinion) of the PHP language and tooling available for self-hosted projects.

### Quality

Chevere follows a [quality standard](../architecture/standard/quality.md) and provides **very** shiny and clean tools. You can enjoy and trust when you work with it.

## Origin

Chevere begun as the supporting framework for [Chevereto 4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto). Development started about mid-2018, carrying a complete modernization of the previous Chevereto's supporting framework ([G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/)).

While Chevereto drove initial development, Chevere is a different organization with its own goals.

> Both [Chevere](https://chevere.org) and [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) are made by the same developer, [Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com) (Hey there 👋🏾).

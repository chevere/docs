# Introduction

## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a general purpose PHP development framework made for building extensible [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) applications. Unlike other frameworks, Chevere is designed for *everything*, not just web and it provides the tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given software application from command line tools, Content Management Systems, headless-APIs up to anything you may think of.

Chevere has this flexibility and mindset because it has been designed to be used to create [self-hosted software](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).

## Core concepts

### Clean & Typed

Chevere follows Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand, to change and maintain.

It uses strict strong-types for safe run-time operations and relies mostly on the language to avoid boilerplate code needed to validate dynamic types.

### Extensible

Chevere provides an immutable core library, a tooling for general purposes, with enough flexibility to allow the creation a myriad of systems with the same know-how. It includes the tooling required to extend base instructions using plug-in add-ons as hooks and events.

Extensible applications engage more users and provide a solid foundation for your own application ecosystem.

### Modern & High-quality

Chevere has been designed from scratch for PHP 8, and it uses all the goodies added to it. On top of that it follows own [quality](../architecture/standard/quality.md) standards.

## Origin

Chevere begun as the supporting framework for Chevereto V4. Development started in May-2018, carrying a complete modernization of the previous Chevereto's supporting framework ([G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/)).

While Chevereto drove initial development, Chevere is a different organization with its own goals.

> Both [Chevere](https://chevere.org) and [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) are made by the same developer, [Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com) (Hello!).

# Beginners Guide

To learn how to use this framework will be fairly easy if you already are into developing or extending any kind of software. If you are completely new to server-side software this may be challenging, but nothing to fear about.

::: tip
If you are new to programming this framework may be too _raw_ as Chevere doesn't provide any application model. Feel free to comeback later once you feel more comfortable to learn it.

## Client-Server model

Chevere is made to build [Server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) applications, allowing to implement the [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model). Server-side is everywhere, and the most ubiquitous example are websites which you consume with your favorite web browser (client application).

## PHP

The [PHP](https://www.php.net/) programing language is required to write instructions. You will need to know the [PHP Language Reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php).

To [install PHP for Chevere](installation.md#php) you will need an Unix-like system. If you are using Windows is recommended to install PHP on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), like [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).

You can also use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) if you are into containers.

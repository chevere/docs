# Beginners Guide

To learn how to use this framework will be fairly easy if you already are into developing or extending any kind of software. If you are completely new to server-side software this may be challenging, but nothing to fear about.

## New to Programming?

If you are new to programming this framework may be feel too raw as Chevere takes for granted some programming background. Feel free to comeback later once you feel more comfortable to learn it.

## PHP

For Chevere you will need to use [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and get to know the [PHP Language Reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/langref.php).

To install and use PHP for Chevere you will need an Unix-like system. If you are using Windows is recommended to install PHP on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), like [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl). You can also use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) if you are into containers.

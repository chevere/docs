# Components spec

Components are elements that provide concrete functionality.

## Conventions

Components **must**:

* Define a descriptive name.
* Have a single responsibility.
* Name properties as nouns.
* Declare private/protected properties only.
* Implement a defined [interface](interfaces.md).

Components **should**:

* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer to implement immutability.

## Design

::: tip
Components inherit the [Interface Spec](interfaces.md#design).

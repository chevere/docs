## Introduction

Conventions exists as good practice for keeping the source cohesive as possible. That way, Chevere removes lots of "ifs" by sticking to its own standards.

## Casing

In Chevere, we keep it simple:

* `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces
* `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
* `camelCase` for everything else

## Code Style

Code style is defined at `.php_cs.dist`

> ðŸ˜˜ You can use it to let your IDE automatically format on save

### Use imports

The `use` keyword at the top of the document **must** be used to import all the dependencies. Fully-qualified imports should be avoided in favor of imports and aliases.

```php
use Chevere\Components\Message\Message;

new Message('Prefer to import');
```

```php
new Chevere\Components\Message\Message('...Instead of fully-qualified');
```

## Typing

### Strict Types

To declare strict types is a **must**.

```php
declare(strict_types=1);
```

### Type Hinting

* All parameters, properties and return expressions **should** be type hinted
* Objects **should** be typed against its interface

## Comments

### DocBlocks

DocBlock comments in signatures should be **short** as possible, **relevant** and **omit** the obvious.

* `@param` and `@return` should be used only if is required to provide more context
* `@throws` must be provided for all applicable exceptions

### Logic

Comments in logic are **discouraged** and it should be used only in the following cases:

* `@codeCoverage` tags
* Type hinting (for example, in a loop)
* Warn about a critical situation

## Data Structures

[Data Structures](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ds.phps) **should** be preferred instead of `array`.

## Components

All components must follow the [Interfaces](./interfaces.md), [Exceptions](./exceptions.md) and [Tests](./tests.md) spec. On top of that, components have the following conventions.

Components **must**:

* Have one single responsibility
* Name properties as nouns
* Declare private/protected properties only

Components **should**:

* Prefer composition over inherence
* Prefer to implement immutability
* Provide exceptions in the same namespaceS

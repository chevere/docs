# Introduction

This section outlines the architecture concepts implemented in Chevere. There's a [coding standard](standard/coding.md) among several specs and best practices for pretty much everything.

All these rules have been established to provide consistency for the project, to leverage choices and to provide users with less decisions to make.

ðŸ˜‰ This is a reference for the Chevere framework architecture itself, not for applications made on top of it.

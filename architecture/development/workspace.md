# üìê Workspace

The workspace refers to the working directory where the software is developed.

## IDE

Default IDE of choice by developer is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Chevere provides tooling and recommendations on how to configure this IDE.

### Assets

Templates and settings are at the [.vscode/](https://github.com/chevere/chevere/tree/main/.vscode) folder.

### Template Snippets

[Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) in Visual Studio Code provide an easy way to define templates for code. It is a productivity tool that allows to rapidly cast source code just typing a keyword in the IDE.

Snippets provide this functionality for the IDE:

![Snippets in action](./../../src/screen/snippets-in-action.gif "Snippets in action")

Note that for the example above, the header comment and `strict_types` declaration are automatically provided by the [coding standard formatting](#coding-standards-formatting).

### Extensions

This is a list of the essential extensions that the developer recommends for using Visual Studio Code for developing Chevere.

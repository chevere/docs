# Testing Standard

[Software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) is the activity of checking software quality under a test. It is carried to ensure that the software system is free of errors. It helps to detect bugs, errors, missing requirements, etc.

Testing is all about make sure that the software behave as expected. That the software will always _responds_ in a predictable way every time.

## Testing Framework

Tests should be always compatible with the latest [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) production release. Code coverage requires to install [pcov](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov).

## Requirements

* [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) is **required**
* All components **must** be covered

## Conventions

* Must be named with `Test` suffix
* Must be located at `Tests/<component>/`

## Configuration

Configuration for PHPUnit can be found at `phpunit.xml`. The configuration at `phpunit-report.xml` does testing with code coverage.

## Running tests

To run tests:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml
```

To run tests with code coverage report at `./build/coverage/`:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-report.xml
```

To run filtered tests use the `--filter` option:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-report.xml --filter ActionTest
```

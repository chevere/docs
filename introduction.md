## What is Chevere?

Chevere is a PHP development framework for building extensible server side applications. Unlike almost all other frameworks, Chevere is designed for *everything*, not just web. The core library provides the tooling needed to organize and run the logic of any given application, from a single command up to large systems like Content Management Systems, headless-APIs and more.

## Core concepts

### Extensibility

Chevere aims to ease the process of crafting pluggable applications by providing an architecture allowing to safely extend the application logic. Extensible applications not only do more, it also engage more users and provide a solid fundation for the application own ecosystem.

### Clean Code

Chevere follows the Clean Code principles, which can be resumed as the practice of creating code that is easy to understand and easy to change.

> ðŸ§” _Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._
> â€• Michael Feathers

### Strongly Typed

Chevere embraces strict strong-types, taking advantage of type checking for safe run-time operations. It relies mostly on the language to avoid boilerplate code needed to validate dynamic types.

### Console first

Chevere is built around the console. On its core Chevere is a simple command runner which can me mapped to generate anything. This approach makes Chevere flexible enough to provide all the building blocks needed to create a modern application of any type.

## Origin

Chevere begun as the supporting framework for [Chevereto 4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto). Development started about mid-2018, carrying a complete modernization of the previous Chevereto supporting framework ([G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/)).

While Chevereto drove initial development, Chevere is a different organization with their own goals, shapped by their contributors and users. 

> Both Chevere and Chevereto are projects started by the same developer, [Rodolfo Berrios](https://github.com/rodolfoberrios) (ðŸ˜‰ hi!).
